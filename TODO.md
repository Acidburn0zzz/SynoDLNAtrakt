Movies:

- create name.tmdb (can contain a moviedb id for identify)
- check for name.tmdb (can contain a moviedb id for identify) if found use this id and dont try a manuall search...
- Save nfo file after scrobbeling for the next time...
- postprocessing (move files to a "already watched folder")
- search for movie name without the year if no result is found (wrong year in name etc...)
- check db if movie is in there and viewe for less then 80% (watching on different days) if so add current progress to the on in the db
- update "watching now" scrobble time to at least (3 minutes) (just a "quicklook" doesn't count)
- delete movies watched less than 80% from database after a given time (a month?)
